### Context:
This project was assigned to Mod 1 students in Turing's Front-End Engineering bootcamp. Students were given 6 days to recreate a comp and add functionality to allow users to create, add, and favorite new cards. We had about 5 days of work with about 6-8 hours a day to get the site functional.

### Learning Goals:
- Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

### Wins + Challenges:

#### Wins

- We created a very stable foundation within our CSS and HTML data model.
- We completed our minimum viable product, with all functions operating smoothly.

#### Challenges

 - Working with the elements that were not availble upon page load
 - Working to get our DOM to reflect our data model properly
